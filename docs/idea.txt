Learning Tracker:

This is to track my learning progress. Learning data gets saved for further processing (in the moment as .csv file).

Fields to keep track of:

    - session (session id)
    - date
    - start time
    - end time
    - course (could choose that as dropdown list, could be saved in a json file)
    - activitys (one activity per entry - all is going to be tied to session id)
    - productivity (number from 1 - 10)
    - difficulty of topic (number from 1 - 10)
